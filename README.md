**The Challenge**
  To analyse stock data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. 
  Given excel file provided is a stock ticker report and contained the below data -
    1.	Ticker
    2.	Opening Price
    3.	Closing Price
    4.	High Price
    5.	Low Price
    6.	Volume of stock
  By using the programming language Visual Basic for Applications, I had to write a code that looped through all the stocks for each year and to arrive at the below -
    •	The ticker symbol
    •	Yearly change for each ticker symbol
    •	Percentage change for each ticker symbol
    •	Total volume of the stock
    •	Conditionally formatting to highlight ‘Positive Change’ and in green and ‘Negative Change’ in red.
    •	Calculate the 
      o	Greatest % Increase in value and output the ticker and the value.
      o	Greatest % Decrease in value and output the ticker and the value.
      o	Greatest Total Stock Volume and output the ticker and the value.
